<h2>About This Project</h2>
This project aims to be a simplified project which shows the efficiency differences between the two functions. The first function does work. However, it is not an efficient way of performing these operations. Should this program be used for large calculation or in data science and analysis projects, this program could crash.
The second function also works and is a more efficient way of performing the same task. In the second function we make use of the YIELD statement which provides an exit point and a re-entry point simultaneously.
